Welcome to my first project for phase 1 of Flatiron School. 

This will be a SPA for currency exchange. You will be able to select your currency, and calculate the exchange rate to a different currency. For example, if you are traveling from the United State to Japan, and want to get an idea of how much 100 USD is worth in Japanese Yen, you will simply input 100 USD as your currency and amount, and will get the current market value in Japanese Yen. You can start with any amount of any supported currency, and see the current exchange rate for any other supported currency. 

This is where this application will stop for the intents and purposes of completing the phase 1 project assignment. 

Further down the line, this application will be developed into something larger. Say, for example, you are going to Japan for a week, and want to plan out how much things cost and how much money to bring with you. Using a cost of living API, this application will let you compare different cities around the world. For example, if you currently live in Boston in the US and are travelling to Osaka in Japan, you can compare living costs between two cities. You can compare how much a bottle of water, a public transporation pass, a meal at a restaurant, a night in a hotel, a taxi ride, etc, all cost. As such, you will be able to determine how much money to bring with you. 

Further, the application will be able to do some of that work for you. If you estimate how much money you would spend on a daily basis (eating, drinking, hotel stay, transporation, etc) if you were a tourist in YOUR own city and input that into the application, using the cost of living factor, the application will be able to tell you how much the same experience would cost in the city you are planning to visit. In turn, you will have a better idea of how much money to bring with you on your trip.
